# PET-Calculations
This code calculates the Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) for Pakistan using the FAO Penman-Monteith method based on ERA5 daily climate data. It first loads the Pakistan boundary and ERA5 data, then computes necessary variables like temperature, dewpoint, wind speed, and radiation. Using these inputs, it applies the Penman-Monteith equation to estimate PET for each day in 2023. The results are averaged to compute the annual PET and visualized on a map. The visualization includes a color palette and a legend for interpretation. Finally, the map is centered on Pakistan, displaying the PET values in mm/day.
